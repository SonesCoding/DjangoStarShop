Mr. Otwane, 

There were issues with multiple python installations and order in path as well as 
a silly issue with enabling scripts, but I hope to get a pretty polished result with this project.


I had fiddled with light form work in the previous project, 
so this project I really tried to flesh some small bits out and
reference some of Module5. The way you presented it in class was straightforward and made sense. I looked at very minimal other resources other than for my troubleshooting.
